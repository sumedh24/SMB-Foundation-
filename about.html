  The SMB Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization made up of a volunteer Board of Directors, one part-time staff member and hundreds of donors and supporters who make our work possible. Without the involvement of the individuals and communities that make up our worldwide SMB Foundation family we couldn’t do what we do.The SMB Foundation funds SMB Family, a permanent care home in India for at-risk homeless children who have been abandoned, trafficked or have lost their home and family to poverty, drug/alcohol abuse or illness. We are dedicated to providing these children with a loving home, an excellent education, health care and the confidence to become productive, self-supporting adults. We are investing in the future of India by educating the mothers and fathers, teachers, business leaders, social workers and professionals of the next generation.
